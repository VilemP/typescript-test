# typescript-test
This is just a test project to share with colleagues where we discuss various potential solutions in our future with Typescript :-)

## Initial installation

To use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) package manager run `npm install -g yarn`


## Usage

`yarn test` (`npm test`) runs tests and linter

`yarn base-test` (`npm run base-test`) runs just tests without linter

`yarn lint` (`npm run lint`) runs linter

(`yarn lint` or `npm run build`) creates distribution bundle
